# Crowdfunding ETL

## Description
This project is for building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After the data was transformed, four CSV files were created and used  to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database. We challenged ourselves by completing multiple ways of completing this project, by first extracting and transforming the data with the Python dictionary method and then by using regular expressions.

## Usage
Open the Jupytner notebook to run the code and view the schema in the SQL file
